		<h2>Game Synopsis</h2>
		<p>The game is a 2 player arcade style game. 
		The player will feel a retro, competition based vibe as if they were in an old school arcade. 
		They compete to not only survive but to destroy the other player by the end of the game. 
		The game is set in an intergalactic space tournament where there can be only one winner. 
		The players are spaceships, fighting for survival by destroying the rival planets in their way. 
		Once there are only two survivors, they will battle head to head until there is only one winner of the galactic space battle.</p>
