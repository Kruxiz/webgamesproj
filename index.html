<h1>Breakout 2 Player Game</h1>

<p>The game that we have decided to create is a 2 player variation of the classic game, breakout. We have opted to include a small story based element within the game. This story based element involves the 2 planets(player controlled characters) fighting against each other to destroy the most planets to become the strongest planet in the galaxy.</p>
