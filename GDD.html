<h1>Intergalactic Breakout</h1>
<h2>Team Members</h2>

<h2>Game Description</h2>
<p>The game is a 2 player arcade style game. The player will feel a retro, competition based vibe as if they were in an old school arcade.<br />
 They compete to not only survive but to destroy the other player by the end of the game. <br />
 The game is set in an intergalactic space tournament where there can be only one winner. The players are spaceships, fighting for survival by destroying the rival planets in their way. <br />
 Once there are only two survivors, they will battle head to head until there is only one winner of the galactic space battle.</p>

<h2>Research/Comparison to other existing games:</h2>
<p>The game design is based upon Breakout which is a retro arcade game, involving a paddle and <br />
coloured bricks to destroy. There are similarities where the player moves the paddle/spaceship at the<br />
bottom of the screen to control the ball/laser which in turn destroys the elements on screen. The<br />
difference is that in our new version there is multiplayer and the lure of the game has changed. There <br />
is now an end goal of destroying all other planets and having only one winner by the end of the game.<br />
The game also changed the setting of the game as it is now based in space and utilises the graphics and designs of space combat.</p>
