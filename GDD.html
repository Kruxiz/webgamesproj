				<button class="accordion">1. Game Description</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<h3>1.1 Genre</h3>
					<p>The game is a top down multiplayer shooter game.
					The game rating is Parental Guidance Recommended (PEGI rating) as the game is simple enough for young people to play however the violence aspect may require parental supervision.</p>
					<h3>1.2 Player Experience</h3>
					<p>The player should feel immersed in a competitive tank battle where the end goal is to destroy all other tanks in the game to become the ultimate winner. 
					The player will be involved in quick gameplay with rapid continuous action in the form of shooting ammo from the tanks.</p>
					<h3>1.3 Background Story</h3>
					<p>The game is set in a dystopian future where the only way to survive is to blast your competitors from the face of the earth.
					The rest of the world has crumbled and only the strongest machinery was able to survive.
					The top quality tanks that used to be classified weaponry for the army have been stolen in the anarchy and are now the property of the people.
					Using the stolen war machines, the few remaining survivors must battle to the death for whatever land remains.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">2. Research and Similar Games in the Market</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<h3>2.1 Similar Games in the market</h3>
					<p>The game is based upon the Phaser example “Tanks”. Other similar games on the market are “AZ Tank Game”, “Tank Battle” and “Total Tankage”. 
					These games are typically a top down shooter based upon tank warfare.</p>

					<p><small><em>Screenshot: Total Tankage</em></small></p>
					<h4>2.1.1 Similarities/Differences</h4>
					<p>The game shares similarities with the other games mentioned as they all have a low graphics style gameplay which gives the feel of an arcade style game. 
					The premise of destroying other tanks in the game using artillery is consistent throughout the games. 
					The difference is that in our new version there is multiplayer with more than just 2 players and the lure of the game has changed. 
					There is an end goal of destroying all other tanks and having only one winner by the end of the game. 
					The game also offers the option to change the colour / style of your tank before starting the gameplay.</p>
					<h3>2.2 Elements/Features Adopted</h3>
					<p>Key features adopted from similar games on the market include the simple keyboard movement using the Arrow Keys to move the tank left, right, forward and back. 
					A further similar feature is clicking the right mouse button to fire as this is the best and most ergonomic key for the player to continuously use when firing shots.</p>

				<div class="panel">
					<h3>4.1 Basic Features</h3>
					<p><u>Movement:</u></p>
					<p>Arrow Keys on keyboard to move left, right, up and down.</p>
					<p><u>Fire/Aim:</u></p>
					<p>Mouse to aim and left mouse button click to fire bullets.</p>
					<p><u>Collision Detection:</u></p>
					<p>Keeps player in screen during gameplay.</br>Lose health when shot at and destroy tank when health reaches 0.</p>
					<p><u>Health/Lives System:</u></p>
					<p>Player starts with 100 health and loses 10 health when hit by another player.When the health reaches 0 then the player is dead.</p>
					<p><u>End Game Win Condition:</u></p>
					<p>Once all other players have been destroyed and one remaining player still has health then they are the winner of the game.</p>
					<h3>4.2 Database</h3>
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kC9dTVa.png" alt="Database Design" width="471" height="221">
					<h3>4.3 Multiplayer</h3>
					<p>For implementation of the multiplayer feature, we used Centralised Messaging. 
					We decided to use this method as it is the most efficient in regards to network traffic and as our game does not have a limit on the amount of players who can join the game, this feature was important to optimise. 
					Any messages that are communicated to the players only get sent and stored onto the server one time. 
					If a player requires the message then they must request it and a copy sent over to them. 
					This can cause longer delays as each message must be relayed through the server and the players may need to poll the server for any pending messages for them. 
					The system can continue when a single client is disconnected however if the server itself fails then all clients will be impacted. 
					Variant speeds of internet connect can allow some players an advantage during gameplay which is unfair for those on a lower network connection.</p>

					<h3>4.4 Design Pattern</h3>
					<p>A design pattern can allow the code to be efficient and allow for fewer errors in certain situations.
					A State Pattern was used when designing the menu system as this was the most effective pattern for this type of code.
					A State Pattern enables algorithm selection at runtime and deals with what state or type an object is i.e.
					decides if the system is in the menu section or if it should be running the game.
					This is achieved by encapsulating the state-dependant behaviour (whether the game is in game mode or menu mode).
					The state pattern allows the class to adhere to the open-closed design principle which means that the class is closed for changes in what state there are available however the states themselves are open to extensions. </p>

					<h3>5.1 Gameplay</h3>
					<p>The rules are simple for the game. Each players objective is to destroy all other tanks and be last player standing.
					The game utilises the arcade physics libraries from Phaser to deal with the physics functions in the game. 
					This includes the collision detection, overlaps and motion methods.
					The collision detection determines if a tank has been hit or if the tank has come into contact with another tank in the map.
					The motion implementation allows for a smooth arcade physics style of movement which allows the tank to move left, right, forward and back on the top down map. </p>

					<h3>6.1 Team Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
					<p>Ross - Assets, Website Design and Development</p>
					<p>Madeleine - Project Management, Documentation<p>
					<p>Craig - Multiplayer Development, Diagrams</p>
					<p>Ross took main responsibility for the website by designing and implementing the features directly to the website. 
					Madeleine undertook main responsibility for the documentation side of hte project.
					Craig was in control of developing the multiplayer aspects and designing the UML diagrams for the documentation.
					The team worked well together as we all were assigned our own sections yet continued to discuss what features have been implemented to keep each other up to date on the status of the project.</p>
